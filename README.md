Preface 
Card games have always been the most favorable pastimes throughout the world. There are many types of card game but among them 29 is one of the most popular if not the popular card game. There was a time that a gamer was just happy to play a game in single player mode. Where only the gamer is the sole player and the opponents are some sort of ‘AI’. The main problem with a single player mode game is no matter how hard the game is eventually the player is going to win. Not saying the ‘AI’ competing as the contender is normally easy or not well thought out enough. It’s just that they play in a repetitive way. No matter how many times a gamer dies that gamer can always evolve and after some time a gamer can always find a way to kill or bypass that opponent.  So the demand of a single mode game dissipating in a rapid succession. A new era began in gaming with the multiplayer mode game. Where multiple players can join thorough a server and can play against each other.  29 is one of those games which really can benefit from the multiplayer gaming option. The main purpose of our project is to build a ‘29’ game is will be playable in multiplayer mode. Because truth to be told even if a 29 game is built with a sublime ‘AI’ it is never going to be as fun as 29 built with multiplayer gaming mode. ‘29’ originated in the sub-continent area. So it is very natural that most of us grew up watching family members laughing, enjoying in a family gathering while playing ‘29’. Friends always have great fun playing 29.  But lately these opportunities have been dissipating. Our project ’29’ presents us with a unique opportunity to tear down the obstacles of mere distance or place. A ’29’ with multiplayer gaming option where actual friends can play online is really going to be a whole lot of fun.  

Scope 
The scope of this project is only limited to the gamers as it is a game not a utility software. There is no targeted demography because each and every one will be eligible to play this game.  A gamer who signs up through our app will be able to play the game. One good thing is it’s going to be free. A player will be able to open or join a game room.  Players will be able to chat throughout the game. At least 100 and up to unlimited players will be able to join the game at a time. Standard ‘29’ game rule will be followed to the tee. Gamers will have individual reputation system and score sheet.   Users and their roles:  
    Anonymous Users:  Anonymous users can enter the game but they will have to sign up in order play the game.   
    Registered Users: The main features of the game will be available to the registered users. They will have access   to the following amenities:  
 Registered users will be able to create or join a game room. 
  
 Minimum four players will be needed to start game. In order to do that a user have add friends from the registered users. Then one player will have to create a game and then other players will join the game.   
 If a user after entering the application sees an already created game room just by clicking the host that user will be able to join the game. But some conditions will have to meet. Firstly the host should have to be in the requesting player’s friends list and secondly if there is already four players in the game room that player can’t join.  
 There will be reputation level for each player and there will be score sheet.      

Use Cases of the System:  
 
  Registration  
    An anonymous user and the system are the actors of the use case.  If the anonymous user provides the required information the system will create an account for the user.

    Every user will have a username. In order to find a friend a user have to insert user’s friend’s username through the find friend button. Then a request will go through the system.  
 
  Creating game
    To create a game a user will have to press the create game button. Then the system will automatically create the game. In or to play the game there should be at least 4 players present all the time. If for any reason the host leaves the game the game will be terminated.  
  
  Joining game
